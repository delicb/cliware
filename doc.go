// Package cliware defines base type for HTTP client middleware support.
//
// Cliware does very little on its own. Main purpose is for other packages
// to implement useful HTTP client middlewares and to write clients using
// cliware and set of useful middlewares. That being said, cliware can be used
// on its own with GoLang standard library.
package cliware // import "go.delic.rs/cliware"
